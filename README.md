Control systems in robotics is a fascinating area that is crucial for the successful operation of a robot. Control systems based on reinforcement learning AI algorithms are gaining popularity rapidly these days and I thought I would take a dig at it too. This is just a proof-of-concept type of an attempt and more deeper work will follow.

It is almost canonical to start this with a balancing cart pole problem. In this case, I have simplified it a lot. The well known Q-learning algorithm is used and a look up table is used instead of a deep learning or fitting a function to keep very simple. The full code for this is available here.  

Standard dependencies like numpy, matplotlib, scipy would be required.
